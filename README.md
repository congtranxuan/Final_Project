# Tableau Story and Dashboard
Information on companies using Machine Vision (software) was collected from ThomasNet.com (https://www.thomasnet.com/products/machine-vision-software-45328275-1.html). Information on a total of 68 companies are presented which include location, services provided, number of employees and specific use of machine vision software (specific uses not presented in Tableau visualizations). Data collected is entered into a csv file and read into Tableau.
Office locations represent city and not actual office locations. A second file was downloaded and merged for latitude and longitude data for city locations are from Simple Maps found through  https://simplemaps.com/data/us-zips.
Data presented on Tableau shows company locations and size of company (per number of employees), and services provided (in clusters).
